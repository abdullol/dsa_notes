birds eye view of data structure and algorithm in c# so you can save your ass infront of interviewee



**List:** Collection of items of different datatype <br />
**Array:** Collection of items of same datatype, it has fixed size <br />
**ArrayList:** Collection item of same datatype, it has dynammic/variable size, it can resize itself when needed <br />
**Trees:** data strcuture (DS) that is organized in hierarchical framework composed of nodes, each tree has a root node that can have zero or more child nodes, they could have any datatype or value <br />
**Graph:** tree is actually type of graph, but not all graphs are trees. simply, tree is a connected graph without cycle, it has finite number of vertice(nodes) and finite number of edges connecting the vertices(nodes) <br />
<ul>
<li> **Adjacency:** A vertex is said to be adjacent to another vertex if there is an edge connecting them </li>
<li> **Directed Graph:** The edges in such a graph are represented by arrows to show the direction of the edge. </li>
 </ul>
**Heap:** it is a tree-based data structure (DS) that has a specific order (e.g. 'A' is a parent node of 'C' so they must come one after each other not 'B' or any other node this pattern continues in whole structure) <br />
**Hashtable:** DS that maps keys to value for highly efficient lookup, it's a key value pair where key is used to access items from collection <br />
**Stack:** DS organized as Last in First out (e.g. stack of plates) <br />
**Queue:** DS organized as First in first out (e.g. row of people standing in queue) <br />
**Linear Data structure:** in which data or items are arranged in linear order or they are in non-hierarchical order i.e. Array, Stack, Strings, Queue, Linkedin list etc<br />
**storage structure vs file structure:** <br />
-Storage structure has memory stored in computer system (e.g. RAM) data gets deleted once function is complete<br />
-file structure has memory stored in auxillary memory (harddrive, usb)  where we have to delete or modify it manually<br />
**in 2D Array Data** is stored in rows and column wise, i.e. Row-major order and Column-major order<br />
**Linkedi List Datastructure: ** <br />
-its is linear DS or sequence of data objects where elements are not stored in adjacent memory locations rather elements are linked using pointers to form a chain. each object is called Node. Each node has 2 item, data field and reference to the next node. entry point in a linked list is called head. Where the list is empty, Head has null reference and the last object has reference to null.<br />
-LS is a dynammic DS, it has ability to grow and shrink as needed
**Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path algorithm: ** <br />
